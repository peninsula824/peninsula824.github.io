## Early Project

- [3D Convolutional Neural Network-Based Spectral Unmixing for SERS Imaging]<br>*Final year project ([thesis]).*<br>**Tianyao Tan** (Advisors: Ping Tang, Liyun Zhong)<br>We have designed a 3D self-encoder algorithm based on discrete cosine transform with spatio-temporal global attention mechanism which is designed for realizing a component decomposition unmixing algorithm for scanning Raman imaging of 2D materials MoS2/WSe2.<br> 
<br>We have compared traditional machine learning NMF non-negative matrix decomposition and K-hype kernel abundance estimation algorithm with traditional and deep learning algorithms to realize the reconstruction of the Raman scanning imaging on SOTA level.<br>

- Optimizing Traffic Sign Detection System Using Deep Residual Neural Networks Combined with Analytic Hierarchy Process Model<br>*Junior-year course design.*<br>**Hanlin Cai**, Zheng Li, Jiaqi Hu, Wei Hong Lim, Sew Sun Tiang, Mastaneh Mokayef, Chin Hong Wong<br>The 28th International Conference on Artificial Life and Robotics.<br>Beppu, Japan. February, 2023.<br>Recommended for expanding publication in the Journal of Advances in Artificial Life Robotics.
