## Early Project

- [3D Convolutional Neural Network-Based Spectral Unmixing for SERS Imaging]<br>* Research Assistant([thesis]).*<br>**Tianyao Tan** (Advisors: Dr.Ping Tang, Prof.Liyun Zhong)<br>We have designed a 3D self-encoder algorithm based on discrete cosine transform with spatio-temporal global attention mechanism which is designed for realizing a component decomposition unmixing algorithm for scanning Raman imaging of 2D materials MoS2/WSe2.<br> 
<br>We have compared traditional machine learning NMF non-negative matrix decomposition and K-hype kernel abundance estimation algorithm with traditional and deep learning algorithms to realize the reconstruction of the Raman scanning imaging on SOTA level.<br>
**Achievement:** This is supported by National Natural Science Foundation Project (500210181) with Dr. Ping Tang.

- [Reinforcement Learning-Driven Super-Resolution Imaging (5x Resolution)]<br>*F Research Assistant([thesis]).*<br>**Tianyao Tan** (Advisors: Dr.Ping Tang, Prof.Liyun Zhong)<br>Proposed Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to iteratively optimise system imaging to achieve super-resolution imaging from **MoS2/WSe2** heterojunction at the electron microscope level, reducing imaging noise by 40%+.
