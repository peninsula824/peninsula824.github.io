## Early Project

- **Intelligent Information Processing Laboratory**<br>[3D Convolutional Neural Network-Based Spectral Unmixing for SERS Imaging]([thesis]).<br>**Tianyao Tan** (Advisors: Dr.Ping Tang, Prof.Liyun Zhong)<br>We have designed a 3D self-encoder algorithm based on discrete cosine transform with spatio-temporal global attention mechanism which is designed for realizing a component decomposition unmixing algorithm for scanning Raman imaging of 2D materials MoS2/WSe2.<br> 
<br>We have compared traditional machine learning NMF non-negative matrix decomposition and K-hype kernel abundance estimation algorithm with traditional and deep learning algorithms like A2SAN or VAE to realize the reconstruction of the Raman scanning imaging on SOTA level.<br>
**Funding:** This is supported by National Natural Science Foundation Project (500210181) with Dr. Ping Tang.

- [Reinforcement Learning-Driven Super-Resolution Imaging (5x Resolution)]<br>([thesis]).<br>**Tianyao Tan** (Advisors: Dr.Ping Tang, Prof.Liyun Zhong)<br>Proposed Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework to iteratively optimise system imaging to achieve super-resolution imaging from **MoS2/WSe2** heterojunction at the electron microscope level, reducing imaging noise by 40%+.

**Founding:** This is supported by National Natural Science Foundation Project (500210181) with Dr. Ping Tang.

- **Shanghai Zhangjiang Institute of Mathematics**<br>[Diffusion Models for ISPRS Remote Sensing Data Augmentation]([thesis]).<br>**Tianyao Tan**<br>Training a state-of-the-art generative model based on stable diffusion on the ISPRS dataset generates synthetic
images to improve semantic segmentation accuracy (mIoU +7.0%), comparing the generative stability of stable diffusion models with adversarial neural network GANs, integrating of diffusion-generated data into a U-Net pipeline (PyTorch), and explore the prospects of applying the stable diffusion model to different semantic segmentation networks(Swin-Unet, DeepLab v3, etc).<br>
